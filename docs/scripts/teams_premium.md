## Introduction
As knowledgworkers, meetings determine our day-to-day work. Ineffective meetings are a major challenge for most companies. There are several reasons for this. One of the main reasons is that what was discussed in the meeting was inadequately recorded.
Our real work takes place after the meeting. We refer back to our notes for this. Often, however, there is a lack of a common understanding of what has been decided and who is responsible for taking on which task.
### *What if an AI relieves us of the work of note taking and creates a uniform meeting protocol for all meeting participants?*

## Demo Agenda
- What is possible in Teans Standard
- Prequesits for Teams Premium
- What is the difference to Copilot in Teams
- Teams Premium features
-   Live translation for captions
-   Intelligent recap
- Administrative Features
-   How to create custom meeting templates

## Scope and Disclaimer
### The purpose of this demo is to showcase the capabilities of intelligent recap
As recap is only available after the meeting, we present slides during the meeting, have a Q&A session and use a loop component for real time colaboration.
### Copilot in Teams capabilities
As of today copilot is an early access feature, available through invite only. Therefore it is not part of the demo.
Microsoft is working on a demo experience in EDX. But they are also challange with the fact that they need data in the organisation to demostrate the capabilities of copilot.

As I want to create a template for sensitive meeting I call this "Sensitive".
